## Installation and Usage

To install the latest version of github-pewpew CLI, run this command:

## Why?

Have you ever had too much fun with the GitHub API and ended up creating too many dummy repos? Me too 😅!

I made this little CLI tool to clean up repositories quickly. I'm planning to add some flags and regexp to delete in bulk in the future. [Let me know](http://twitter.com/adrianmg) if that sounds interesting to you.
